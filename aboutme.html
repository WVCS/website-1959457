    <h1> All About Me - Sarah Youssef </h1>
    <p> Hello! My name is Sarah Youssef and I am a junior at Westview Highschool. I took my first coding class in middle school and instantly loved it which is part of the reason why I really wanted to take this class. When I am not in school you can usually find me on the basketball court. I have been playing since seventh grade and love the sport. I also love to be in the kitchen whether that means baking breads and cakes or cooking up dinner. Lastly, I am a student journalist have been for about a year. I work with PBS's Student Reporting Labs and they have given me many oppurtunites like various fellowships and internships.</p>
