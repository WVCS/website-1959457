    <h1> What is CSP? </h1>
    <p> Computer Science Principles" (CSP) is an introductory course in computer science that aims to provide students with a foundational understanding of key concepts in the field. The course is designed to be accessible to students with varying levels of prior experience in computer science. The goal of Computer Science Principles is to provide students with a broad awareness of the principles underlying computer science, fostering computational thinking skills that are valuable in various domains and career paths.It typically covers a range of topics, including:
       </p>
<br>
      <br>
 <p1>
1. Computational Thinking: Emphasizes problem-solving skills and the ability to formulate problems and their solutions in a way that can be effectively processed by a computer.
<br>
  <br>
2. Programming and Coding: Introduces basic programming concepts and languages to enable students to write simple programs.
<br>
   <br>
3. Algorithms: Covers the design and analysis of algorithms, which are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems.
<br>
   <br>
4. Data and Information: Explores how data is collected, organized, and processed, as well as the concepts of databases and data analysis.
<br>
   <br>
5. Abstraction and Modeling: Teaches the process of abstraction, where complex systems are simplified for better understanding, and the creation of models to represent real-world phenomena.
<br>
   <br>
6. Connections to Other Fields: Highlights the interdisciplinary nature of computer science by exploring its connections to other fields such as mathematics, science, and engineering.
<br>
   <br>
7. Impact of Computing: Examines the societal and ethical implications of computer science, including issues related to privacy, security, and the responsible use of technology.
